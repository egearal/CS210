## What is Bouldering?
Bouldering is the indoor version of rock climbing where there are different difficulties of "routes"(boulders) to climb each with varying difficulties. The difficulty levels go to an ascending order (in this analsysis from V0 easiest to v5 hardest). There are different styles of boulders called Overhang and Slab wall. Overhang is as the name suggest where the boulders bolted on the ceiling so you are very upper body dependant and cant really use your legs much. Slabs are the opposite where the boulders are bolted on a flat wall however the holds become much harder and smoother to grip which increases the difficulty in different ways.


## Background
This project will be an analysis of the bouldering journey that took place during 2021.


## Data Gathering
The data gathered was done through an app called TopLogger which takes a record of all the boulders you have done, whilst keeping their grades, how many attempts it took you to finish and what type of boulder it is along with the gym where it was logged. Which all of this data was downloaded via a csv file which then was turned into an excel for easier reading.


## Sample size
There have been 2 different (bouldering) gyms that have been gone to and alternated between. There is a really high amount of exclusive individual bouldering routes to attempt since sections of each gym get replaced every week giving enough time to attempt new boulders through out this journey. Each one of these gyms have 7 sections and each of these sections have 19 individual boulders and these boulders levels go as followed: 3 v0's per section, 4 v1-v2, 5 v2-v3, 4 v4-v5, 3 v5-v6.
