Description: My project aims to analyze relationship between the movies IMDB ratings, and how many oscar they have won. We can see if winning more Oscar correlates with higher IMDB rating as a trend, and even check their genres, and release years. My personal interest on movies, and their ratings, and personally me disliking imdb ratings - I might finally show that IMDB ratings doesn't matter in how good a movie is (Oscar is questionable too)

I will Use Phyton, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (maybe Seaborn and Jupyter)

My first dataset has information about Oscar Winners, Movie titles, Categories, and years. 
Second data set has IMDB ratings, years, categories, and release date.
